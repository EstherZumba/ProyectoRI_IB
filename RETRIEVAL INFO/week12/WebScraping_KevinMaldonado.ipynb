            "Descripción: We’re betting you have at least one can of these workhorse legumes in your pantry.\n",
            "Ingredientes:\n",
            "Instrucciones:\n",
            "- Creating a meal doesn't have to be expensive, complicated or include lots of ingredients. In fact, some of the best meals start with a can–in this case, of chickpeas. These hearty pantry heroes also known as garbanzo beans are the perfect protein for crafting quick and easy meals.\n",
            "- Like other beans, canned chickpeas are a satisfying food. That's because they're loaded with protein and fiber, nutritional components \"used\" slowly by the body, thereby contributing to satiety. They're also economical, typically costing less than a dollar for one (15-ounce) can. And using them is a breeze. All you have to do is open the can, rinse them off, and add them to your dish. That's it! No need to be concerned about cooking to a certain temperature like you do with meat and no need to stress about long cook times, since canned beans come fully cooked.\n",
            "- Since chickpeas are such a versatile ingredient, you can use them in a variety of recipes within a wide range of cuisines. Ready to crack open your can of chickpeas? Here are some of our favorite recipes, all using fewer than six ingredients.\n",
            "- Welcome to Taco Tuesday with a vegetarian, chickpea twist! This recipe is perfect for any weeknight meal. Simply cook up your can of chickpeas with a packet of prepared taco seasoning mix and you're ready. And don't forget the toppings: Add shredded cheese, lettuce, salsa, and sour cream for a peak taco experience.\n",
            "- Store-bought pesto helps this meal come together quickly. And even though the recipe is written for two servings, it can easily be doubled or tripled to serve more. Zoodles can be found in both the refrigerated section of the produce department and in the frozen section of your grocery store.\n",
            "- If you love tuna salad, you'll love this mock version made with a can of chickpeas. The recipe comes together in minutes and is great served on toast, crackers, or even wrapped in lettuce. If sweet pickle relish isn't your thing, consider using the dill version or chop up your favorite pickled vegetable and use that instead.\n",
            "- Sheet pan meals are a great hands-off cooking method on any night; to save more time, buy precut, bagged cauliflower. On the other hand, if your grocery store has purple or green cauliflower, give those a try for a gorgeous twist. Make it a meal by serving with white, brown, or wild rice.\n",
            "- This recipe is perfect for a warm, summer day. The combination of seasonal tomatoes and fresh mint makes for a light, refreshing meal. If you can't find halloumi cheese, feta cheese makes a fine substitute.\n",
            "- Quick-cooking quinoa helps this meal come together quickly; chickpeas make for a perfect, hearty bite. Amp up the tomatoes and parsley for a more Mediterranean vibe.\n",
            "- Chickpeas definitely shine in this dish, especially when dressed with a simple combination of lemon juice, olive oil, and parsley. This salad pairs well with pita or can be served over lettuce for an entree salad option.\n",
            "- Creamy and packed with dill and lemon, this chickpea recipe is a great meal for when you need something fast. Serve it on crisp, flatbread crackers or between two slices of toasted baguette.  Or just enjoy it by the spoonful.\n",
            "- Chaat masala is a dried spice blend popular in South Asian cuisine and pairs perfectly with meaty chickpeas. If you can't find it at your grocery store, try a local or online spice shop (or make your own, here).\n",
            "- This chickpea recipe is a great make-ahead meal option. The ingredients can be prepped up to two days in advance and the jars can be assembled the night before you plan on enjoying them.\n",

            "Instrucciones:\n",
            "- Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.\n",
            "- In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that way, not with this method.\n",
            "- Unlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the chicken with sauce and cheese. The key to great non-soggy chicken Parmesan? Don't put any sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a little bit of sauce on top, so the breading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot of sauce on your chicken Parmesan, that's fine, you can always serve extra sauce on the side. I also use some actual Parmesan cheese in this recipe! Curiously, most versions of chicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. Here, I'm going with a delicious mixture of fresh mozzarella, tangy Provolone and real Parmesan.\n",
            "- Another little trick I employ here is to add some grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, which adds another layer of flavor. You'll fry the breadcrumb and Parmesan crusted chicken breasts just to golden brown before transferring them to a baking pan and adding sauce (but not too much!), cheese, and herbs. Okay, now let's break it down.\n",

            "- If you're making steaks inside, you've come to the right place. This technique for cooking steak in a cast iron skillet is unbeatable. What sets it apart? It starts on the stove in a cast iron skillet, but you'll finish the steak in the oven. The stovetop-to-oven method produces steaks with a deeply caramelized crust and a tender, perfectly cooked interior.\n",
            "- We love this oven-finished steak recipe for a lot of reasons. To name a few:\n",
            "- The skillet is the star of the show. Why? Cast iron absorbs and retains heat like no other surface. It heats up fast and cooks evenly. A hot cast iron skillet puts a quick sear on steaks, creating a beautiful caramelized crust, without overcooking the center of the steak. Also, the cast iron skillet goes from stovetop to oven with ease.\n",
            "- This recipe calls for beef top-sirloin steaks. Choose steaks that are at least 1-inch thick. If the steak is too thin, the inside will overcook before the beautiful caramelized crust can form on the outside. Of course, this stovetop-to-oven technique works well for more expensive cuts, too.\n",
            "- Allrecipes community member Ken Turnbull loves the technique for thick steaks with nice marbling: \"I learned this method from a good steak house almost 50 years ago and always have the best results,\" he says.\n",
            "- This simple steak recipe calls for marinating your top-sirloin steaks in a simple marinade made up of common ingredients you likely have on hand: Orange juice, cider vinegar, olive oil, and Worcestershire sauce.\n",
            "- The ideal steak marinades are simple mixtures of acid (OJ and cider), fat (olive oil), and seasonings (Worcestershire sauce).

            "- This dish is packed with veggies, beef, and saucy flavors for a weeknight dinner warrior that checks all the boxes. Served with rice or lo mein noodles, this will be the best beef stir-fry you've ever made.\n",
            "- The most time-consuming part of making stir-fry is all the chopping. Slicing your meat and veggies into smaller bite-sized pieces can take a little bit of time and effort, but it's worth it for the end result.\n",
            "- After you've chopped all your ingredients, you'll cook the beef on one side of the wok, or another large frying pan, and the veggies on the other side of the wok. Once they're all cooked, you can mix the two sides together and add the soy sauce and sesame seeds.\n",
            "- Some stir-fry recipes use a specific stir-fry sauce, which can be as basic as broth, soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine vinegar. This quick stir-fry calls for only soy sauce. But you can feel free to add a stir-fry sauce or marinate your beef in one if you prefer.\n",

            "- Beef chuck steak is the most economical choice, but it does require some extra trimming. You'll want to remove the tough tissue from the steaks before frying.\n",
            "- If possible, you should use a wok to make beef stir-fry. Woks are large and have sloping sides that let you cook the entire stir-fry in one pan, so you can easily stir and flip the food without fear of it flying out. They also are designed to cook foods quicker than skillets and with less oil.\n",

            "- When cooking, make sure you heat the pan and oil up first before adding your ingredients — they should sizzle as soon as they hit the heat. And always use an oil with a high smoke point, like canola or peanut oil, for the best stir-fry results.\n",

            "- 1 teaspoon paprika\n",

            "- 1 cup chicken stock\n",
            "- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n",

            "Instrucciones:\n",
            "- Feeling the pressure to roast a whole bird this Thanksgiving? We're here to tell you that roasting a turkey breast gives you the same great flavor, while saving you money, fridge space, and effort.\n",
            "- A turkey breast is generally sized to feed two to three people with leftovers, so it's the perfect choice for a scaled-down celebration.\n",
            "- This oven-roasted turkey breast is slathered with an herb butter both underneath and on top of the skin, yielding juicy, flavorful meat and a crispy skin. Be sure to save the drippings for the accompanying turkey gravy!\n",
            "- We're partial to bone-in turkey breast because it yields more flavorful, juicier meat. Bone-in turkey breasts tend to be larger and can be sold as a half breast or a full breast (two halves joined at the bone). Boneless turkey breasts typically feature just one breast. You can use boneless in this recipe if you want (we'd still recommend skin-on), but you'll likely need to decrease the cooking time to accommodate for its smaller size.\n",
            "- As a rule of thumb, plan to purchase 1 ½ pounds of turkey per person with leftovers or 1 pound of turkey per person without leftovers.\n",
            "- This recipe calls for a 3-pound turkey breast, which will easily feed two to three adults, although you can scale it up or down as needed. For more, check out our handy turkey serving size chart.\n",
            "- In general, you'll want to cook a bone-in turkey breast for about 20 minutes per pound at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C), or until it reaches a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\n",
            "- To temp the turkey, insert an instant-read meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast, not touching the bone. Be sure to allow the turkey to rest for 10-15 minutes before serving so the juices have to settle into the meat.\n",
            "- If you do end up with leftovers, there are countless ways to repurpose roasted turkey breast. Add it to casseroles like this Easy Turkey Tetrazzini or sandwiches like this Thanksgiving Sandwich. Browse our entire collection of leftover turkey recipes.\n",
            "- \"So much easier than cooking the whole bird, and not a scrap was leftover,\" says reviewer Peter Downing.\n",
            "- \"The gravy was especially good — I did use all the drippings instead of just a tablespoon and that was a good thing as my family finished it all!\" says reviewer tmtorby.\n",
            "- \"I also roasted it over some veggies: an onion, celery and parsnips. Everything including the gravy was delicious!\" says reviewer msteingold.\n",
            "- Editorial contributions by Melanie Fincher\n",
            "- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\n",
            "- Mix 1/4 cup butter, garlic, paprika, Italian seasoning, garlic and herb seasoning, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.\n",
            "- Place turkey breast with skin-side up into a roasting pan. Loosen skin with your fingers; brush 1/2 of the butter mixture over the turkey breast and underneath the skin. Reserve remaining butter mixture. Tent turkey breast loosely with aluminum foil.\n",
            "- Roast in the preheated oven for 1 hour; baste turkey breast with remaining butter mixture. Return to oven and roast until the juices run clear and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast, not touching bone, reads 165 degrees F (65 degrees C), about 30 more minutes. Let turkey breast rest 10 to 15 minutes before serving.\n",
            "- While turkey is resting, transfer pan drippings to a skillet. Skim off excess grease, leaving about 1 tablespoon in skillet. Place skillet over low heat; cook and stir shallot in turkey grease until opaque, about 5 minutes.\n",
            "- Melt 1 tablespoon butter in skillet with shallot and whisk in white wine, scraping any browned bits of food from skillet. Whisk in chicken stock and flour until smooth. Bring to a simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened. For a creamier, lighter gravy, whisk in half-and-half.\n",

            "- To \"spatchcock\" means to remove a bird's backbone so that it will lay flat while cooking. This method (also known as butterflying) ensures even cooking, juicier meat, and a quicker cooking time. Why? All the turkey parts are exposed to the same amount of heat for the same duration of time, so you don't have to wait around for the thighs to finish cooking while the breast gets dry.\n",

            "- Of course, you'll need to take the turkey's internal temperature before serving. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 165 degrees F.\n",
            "- \"When you use this method, there's no waking up at 6 a.m. to get the turkey in the oven,\" according to culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a.

Learn all about this boldly savory dish, including tips on choosing the best beans and what to serve alongside it.\n",
            "- This multifaceted Louisiana-style red beans and rice recipe is made easier by breaking down the prep into small steps. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:\n",
            "- Start by soaking your beans overnight, and dicing any vegetables beforehand.\n",
            "- When you're ready to begin, transfer the soaked beans to a large pot with water. Then, saute onions, bell peppers, garlic, and celery in an oiled skillet until a bit of color appears. Add the cooked vegetables, bay leaves, Cajun seasoning, and other spices to the beans.\n",
            "- Bring the bean mixture to a boil before reducing the heat and allowing the ingredients to simmer for two to two and a half hours. Steam the rice during this time and set it aside. Add Andouille sausage to the beans and cook for an additional half-hour. After cooking, pour the spicy sausage and beans over rice, and enjoy a piping hot bowl of tender, meaty, and flavorful perfection.\n",
            "- Red beans and kidney beans share a similar color, but they're actually two different types of legumes. Red beans are small, rounded, and have a faintly nutty taste. Red kidney beans are larger in size, with thicker skin and a slightly richer hue.\n",
            "- Both can be used to make an appetizing red beans and rice dish, but dried kidney beans may have to soak longer before cooking. Using dry beans in this recipe ensures that they retain their shape during cooking.\n",
            "- Dried beans should be soaked prior to cooking for easier digestion and faster cook time. There are two commonly used ways to soak beans: overnight or quick soak. The overnight method is incredibly simple — add beans to a large stockpot and cover them with twice their volume in water. Cover and let sit overnight.\n",
            "- Quick soaking consists of bringing dried beans and water to a boil before removing them from heat and allowing the beans to sit for one to four hours (or until they're easily squeezed).\n",
            "- Red beans and rice is a versatile recipe that can act as a main or side dish. The big, hearty flavors pair well with foods like cornbread, collard greens, barbecued meats, and fried chicken.\n",
            "- Leftover red beans should be stored separately from rice to discourage mushiness. Place both components in their own sealed container and refrigerate for up to a week.\n",
            "- To freeze your leftovers, place cooled, single servings of rice into freezer bags and top with a commensurate portion of beans. Tightly seal the bags, and freeze for up to three months.\n",
            "- \"I'm a Louisiana boy who grew up eating red beans and rice, shares reviewer jChase. \"This recipe is the real deal. It's become a staple in my home and I serve it up twice a month.\"\n",
            "- \"I made substitutions because I did not want to venture out to the market for ingredients I did not have,\" says home cook Rea. \"This time, I used chorizo sausage, celery powder, and green pepper from my garden. I recommend it as-is, or with personal adjustments!\"\n",
            "- \"All I can say is wow!\" raves Lesley. \"I served half that night for dinner (over white jasmine rice) and the rest I froze in individual servings for a later date. A 5-star recipe for sure!\"\n",
